          <h1>Imitating Professional and Academic Genres</h1>
          <p>
            <i>The impact of the world's reality upon human existence is felt and received as a conditioning force.</i>
            <br>Hannah Arendt <br>
          </p>
          <p>In the following section, I identify and examine how SPN affiliates imitate academic and professional genres to produce and circulate disinformation and explain why this tactic is effective. Digital writing environments make it easier for to publish disinformation that mimics academic and professional genres because it is not beholden to an intricate and complex network of peer-reviewed feedback, fact-checking, and verification processes. Using websites to imitate academic and professional genres and their conventions allows the SPN to avoid quality control, checks and balances, and standard gatekeeping measures found at a reptuable and nationally renowned publication outlet. Imitating academic and professional genres masks misleading content and enables the SPN to build a complex network of disinformation that is difficult to expose. In this section, I examine several different genres the SPN uses to create and embed disinformation in fake peer-reviewed journal articles, research reports, white papers, editorials, news and policy reports and reviews, and graphs and charts to manufacture credibility. Every SPN website I examined had a research or publication page that provides audiences with access to documents that push the same <a href="narrative.html">target issues</a> across platforms, creating a large network for triangulating disinformation. The publication link on the navigation bar on each website creates an illusion of professionalism because of the presence of authoritative genres. </p>
          <p>For example, in figure 1, the Competitive Enterprise Institute's (CEI) website has additional links on its navigation bar for users to access studies, testimony, and coalition letters. The presence of these genres signal to audiences the presence of credibility. All SPN websites have a publications tab that provides links to different authoritative genres.</p>

          </p>
          <p>The SPN takes advantage of the well-estabilished respect for professional and academic genres to disguise disinformation. Building disinformation on the SPN websites starts with the structures and forms of authoritative genres. Structure relates to how messages are "apportioned and sequenced" (Hart & Daughton, p. 103), and form is related to "patterns of meaning audiences generate" from the message structure (Hart & Daughton, p. 104). Genres are the product of specific organizational methods for structuring content that lead audiences to form meaning from those structures. Audiences locate meaning in the structures of the text, so the structures can become a representation of knowledge and credibility without a comprehensive understanding of the content. Bawarshi (2003) emphasizes that "Structures, in short, are both the ideology and the enactment of the ideology" (p. 88) irregardless of the content.</p>
          <p>It is the structures of a well-established professional and academic genre that signal to audiences a certain quality of information exists within the genre's boundaries. Structure argues without the aid of content, so the presence of certain structures can become a substitute for credibility. Using the conventions and standards for professional and academic genres to obfuscate disinformation is an effective tactic. Genres shape how audiences generate meaning because they are "a class of messages sharing important structural and content features" that cater to the "special expectations in an audience" (Hart & Daughton, p. 104). The presence of academic and professional conventions in a digital source can signify credibility when there is none because the appearance of privileged structures can satisfy an audience's expectations for truth. The use of certain genres can establish trust without inviting verification. This means that genres are the primnary medium for hiding and moving disinformation around digitial writing environments. The conventions are a message that form "special expectations in an audience" (Hart & Daughton, p. 104) and become systematized, operationalized, and invisible over time. Imitating an academic genre can bolster an illusion of credbility, and understanding how disinformation networks mimic authoritative genres is a form of crap detection. </p>
          <p> Professional and academic genres are “codified materiality anchored in texts, behaviors, and composing habits” that many people rely on to mark places and spaces as trustworthy (Anderson and Sayers, 2015 p. 83). Many people who see these genres on a website will assume a specific codified materiality of actions and behaviors took place to create them and won't find them suspicious. Genres gain tremendous power and authority from their "historical roots" (Hart & Daughton, p. 119) and cultural captial. A closer examination of SPN websites demonstrates how they use genres to transport disinformation. Affiliates like the Mackinac Institute have a <a href="https://www.mackinac.org/publications" target="_blank"> publications</a> page to house specicality genres, and the Illinois Policy Forum (IPF) website has a page for dozens of research reports full of <a href="homegrown.html">homegrown</a> research. Below are several links to IPF publication pages students can explore for disinformation. </p>

            <i>
              <a href="https://www.marketsandmorality.com/index.php/mandm/index" target="_blank">The Journal of Markets and Morality</a>
            </i> is the Acton Institute's peer-reviewed publication and another example of how the SPN imitates an academic peer-reviewed journal to create ethos. This journal is the best simulation of professional scholarship I found on any of the websites I examined for this study. On the surface, the journal appears to be a credible publication outlet, with a focus on using religion and morals to evaluate, critique, and design economic policies. However, the journal is funded by the Acton Institute, an SPN affiliate, and all of the articles promote the same SPN narrative and pseudo claims. Knowing how publications imitate genres and reference academic articles that are disconnected from their central claims is a disinformation tactic and recognizing this tactic is a form of crap detection. Kress and van Leeuwen (2006) elaborate on how the imitation process works, noting that "neutral, purely informative (linguistic) texts which emerge in newspaper reporting, government publications, social science reports, and so on, realize, articulate and disseminate 'discourses' as ideological positions just as much as do texts which more explicitly editorialize or propagandize” (p. 14). Relying on specific types of professional genres to distribute and circulate disinformation is a form of ideological positioning that takes advantage of an audience's value system and lack of familiarity with the unique and complex discourses that instantiate those professional genres. The conventions for professional genres become the representations of the form, and the presence of these conventions becomes a representation for empirical honesty.
          </p>
          <p>For example, the Indiana Policy Review (IPR) adopts the structures of a peer-reviewed journal to manufacture the appearance of credibility. </p>

          </p>
          <p>The <a href="https://inpolicy.org/" target="_blank">IPR's journal</a> is for members-only, but anyone can access an issue for free online. The term journal embodies a specific level of ethos and generates an expectation for a certain level of quality of information that simply does not exist in the IPR journal. Below is an index of titles for some of the publications in the journal: </p>

          </p>
          <p>Figure 4: Indiana Policy Review (IPR). Journal Publication. 6-8-2020. </center> The content and focus of the publications in this journal are unlike the publications found in respected and accredited peer-reviewed journals, but some of the structures of an academic journal are distinctly present. Again, using the term journal evokes the "powerful epistemic and ontological functions" of academic research publications (McNely and Teston, 2015, p. 114). Moreover, if the content in the journal article is structured accordingly, if the content is glued together with a specific set of conventions in a particular way, audiences will trust the article. Bawarshi explains that "Structures both provide a defined, socially recognized, and ideological action-potential (what individuals can do in a given situation) as well as the means of instantiating that potential as actualized social practice in space and time" (p. 89). If imitating the structures can mask the truth, then so can the forms. </p>

          </p>
          <p>The disclaimer helps launder disinformation into trusted research and scholarship. Anyone can make these statements without following through on the guarantee. Miller (1994) explains that “The rules and resources of a genre provide reproducible speaker and addressee roles” that feel stable and reliable (p. 71). "Genres are <i>preservative</i>; they keep established social patterns viable" (Hart & Daughton, p. 119) and they offer an illusion of stability or "cultural rationality” (Miller, C., 1984, p. 165) that reduces the understanding of complex systems to anectdotes. Examining how disinformation networks rely on genres to design and spread misleading information, and how audiences generate meaning from, with, and through those genres, reveals how structures shape and control how audiences form meaning, and how audiences correlate the presence of genre structures with credibility. A genre can become a masking agent for misleading research, data, and content. "Genres are conservative. They keep things in place. To speak in established ways by following the rules is to tip one's hat to the forces-that-be" even if what is said is false (Hart & Daughton, p. 117). If it appears someone followed the rules, there are less questions about the content. The same rule applies when the SPN interjects <a href="homegrown.html">homegrown</a> research to support misleading claims. </p>
