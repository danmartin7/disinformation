          <h1>The State Policy Network (SPN)</h1>
          <p>Many companies and organizations in the US are now heavily investing in right-wing think tanks that create and circulate digital disinformation that benefits their agendas. The SPN is a low-profile, faux news network and reseach organization that uses a non-profit status to mask and fund its disinformation network. The Center for Media and Democracy (2013) published a report on the SPN that labeled it a far-right group of organized lobbyists who use a variety of disinformation tactics to mask their behaviors, movements, and actions from the general public. SPN Affiliates like the Idaho Freedom Foundation <a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Idaho_Freedom_Foundation" target="_blank">(IFF)</a> are committed to influencing state and national legislation. The IFF:
          <blockquote>had three registered lobbyists, was a constant presence in the Capitol and led the opposition to the governor's biggest legislative proposal of the session, the bill creating a state-based health insurance exchange. It rated 150 bills against its agenda, assigning positive or negative scores, and tracked lawmakers' votes. The group writes legislation, testifies to committees, sponsors lectures and tours for legislators, conducts polls, publishes reports and sends out emails, and its lawmaker scores have been prominently featured in campaign ads. (The Center for Media and Democracy, p. 14)</blockquote>
          </P>
          <p>The SPN is indirectly funded by the Koch brothers and receives a significant amount of money from donors like The Walton Foundation; The Roe Foundation; The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation; The Castle Rock Foundation; The Scaife Foundation; Art Pope; and the DeVos Foundation. These particular foundations continuously fund far-right political agendas that viciously defend corporate interests and profits over pro humanist narratives. The <a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Goldwater_Institute" target="_blank">Goldwater Institute</a> has received over $800,000 from the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation. These foundations help finance the distortion of media content to benefit their financial interests. The Center for Media and Democracy reported that “When the Koch brothers want to see lower corporate taxes and fewer pollution regulations so Koch Industries can see higher profits, contributing to right-wing think tanks that aggressively call for lowering or eliminating corporate taxes and removing environmental regulations serves as an investment that aids their personal agenda” (p. 22). Donating to the SPN is an investment in far-right media manipulation and networked disinformation. </p>
          <p> The SPN provides organizations, corporations, and people who want to influence and shape public perception and legislation a place to donate to that cause. Corporations are always looking for a way to lobby for legislation that will promote thier interests and increase their profits, and the SPN helps make that possible with the aid of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). This council is a lobbying consultant that helps paying customers draft model bills. Ironically, the ALEC's founding motto is to avoid creating propaganda and succumbing to political influence. This motto is a distraction that will limit people from accusing the ALEC of breaking the rules it claims to fight against. The SPN connects corporate donors with the ALEC, and the ALEC provides these corporations with an opportunity to write and promote model bills into laws. For a membership fee, the ALEC gives corporations and special interest groups an opportunity to collaborate on writing model bills and soliciting them to state and local legislators for consideration. Model bills are the ultimate objective for corporations, the SPN, and the ALEC because they are one step away from becoming an actual bill (The Center for Media and Democracy, p. 4). The SPN and the ALEC bridge corporate interests at the state level with state legislators, and model bills have become laws on several occasions. The SPN seeks to develop and nurture relationships between corporate interests and state politicians. Any individual or business interested in influencing state policies and legislation can donate money directly to their local SPN affiliate to initate a conversation with the ALEC. The representatives for the corporation and the ALEC work together to design model bills for the state legislators to review and consider proposing as an actual bill. The SPN brings corporate interests to the ALEC, and the ALEC connects corporations with politicians. Sustaining and nurturing these relationships are the primary catalysts for generating disinformation across websites. </p>

            <a href="Sourcewatch.org published a copy of the 25-page SPN" target="_blank">Sourcewatch.org</a> published a copy of the 25-page SPN membership list that includes over 57,000 donors. SPN donors range from corporations in the gas, oil, mining, drilling, lumber, and tobacco industry to Blue Bell Ice Cream and John Deere. SPN members are part of a network of industries who oppose government regulations on numerous issues because regulations impact profits. This opposition to regulation leads to the <a href="exigence.html">exigence</a> for making disinformation and shifting the narrative away from the dangers these industries pose on the earth and human equity, opportunity, and health. The Center for Media and Democracy identifies key political motivations that the ALEC consistently bolsters: tax policies that benefit the rich; privatizing education, prisons, and health care; unregulated energy production; increased voter restrictions; and criminalize diversity (p. 5). Several of these motivations are built into the SPN's <a href="narrative.html">narrative</a> that is repeated on its affiliates' websites. The repetition of disinformation dislodges long standing facts that are difficult to undermine. All the SPN affiliates are a tightly woven, well-funded network of foundations, institutes, and councils that uses <a href="spnwebsites.html">websites</a> to hide disinformation. SPN foundations and institutes are diligently working to weave a digital tapestry of far-right faux news into the country's cultural fabric, creating massive echo chambers and disinformation networks that are difficult to escape. Avoiding being harmed by disinformation requires developing the ability to recognize disinplatforms and their <a href="intro.html">disinformation tactics.</a>
