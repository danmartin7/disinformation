                <p>Carolyne King (2023) contends that our "current strategies" for reading digital media are "ineffective" because they focus on analyzing "static" characteristics for texts like the "author, publication date, and venue" (p. 415). Reading
                    on screens requires different types of technical literacies and reading behaviors. King asserts that "a text's visual materiality impacts students reading behaviors" (p. 416) and they need to acquire multiple frames for analyzing digital
                    writing environments that can account for how "context, interactivity, [and] circulation” (Eyman, 2015, p. 93) shape digital information. Author, date, and venue are still important rhetorical features to examine when analyzing sources
                    in digital writing environments, but these environments drastically alter what an author is or can be and how an author establishes and accounts for credibility. Who is creating the information and where it comes from are still important
                    and viable questions to answer, but the answers to these questions are more unstable in digital writing environments. Selfe (1998) argued over two decades ago that students need to learn how to "understand the complex ways in which
                    technology has become linked with our conception of literacy” and that digital literacies are always evolving with the invention of new digital tools and platforms (p. 37). Audiences need to understand that digital writing environments
                    contain numerous modal affordances and nonlinear meaning-making processes that pull users' attention into multiple directions. Over a decade ago, Howard Rheingold (2012) argued that the general public needs more sophisticated “crap
                    detection” skills that are built from a broader understanding of how disinformation moves across media platforms (p. 18). Recognizing how disinformation is rhetorically situated in a network is a sophisticated form of crap detection
                    and a critical digital literacy students need to learn.</p>

                <p>Teaching students how to recognize disinformation requires expanding their understanding of digitial literacies. This webtext is designed to provide both an overview of how a disinformation network functions and examples of what disinformation
                    looks like and how it is manufactured. My research on disinformation evinced that there is a need for more examples of what disinformation looks and sounds like across a range of modes and mediums. Miller and Leon (2017) argue that
                    “Networked literacies call for interactive pedagogies that are attuned to the social-cognitive networks that shape how we process information” (p. 11). Learning how disinformation is networked across multiple digital writing environments
                    can prepare students to navigate an increasingly unverifibale, pseudo media culture and autocratic information systems, helping them avoid defaulting to print their literacies to interpret diffuse digital content. “The rhetorical dynamics
                    of network literacies complicate print-centric assumptions that close reading teaches students to be reasonable” (Miller & Leon, p. 13). Close reading is invaluable for combatting disinformation, but identifying a disinformation networks
                    requires students to determine how and where digital platforms are connected to each other and how they gain power from the network. Digital writing environments allow disinformation to easily fragment into a network of websites that
                    appear independent of each other. Craig (2017) examines the literacies of fake news and outlines how “fake news makers' efforts emphasize the importance of developing a network-specific information literacy” (p. 24). Understanding
                    how disinformation is networked in digital writing environments is vital for identifying misleading research, data, and publications. </p>

                <p>
                    Learning how to critically interpret digital disinformation requires students to become aware of how networked spaces can interact with and validate each other. Digital writing environments are responsible for initiating a series of “interior transformations
                    of consciousness” that are very different from print literacy transformations of consciousness (Ong, 2002, p. 23). How we store, access, organize, retrieve, and circulate digital information shapes how we think about that information.
                    A formative, pedagogical approach to addressing these cognitive transformations is implementing metacognition and reflection activities that ask students to practice analyzing disinformation networks and exposing the intricate systems
                    disinformers use to produce, sanitize, and circulate misleading content. Selber (2004) emphasizes that metadiscourse heuristics are vital for revealing how digital spaces and tools impose and embody socio-political ideologies. Selber
                    claims that “Metadiscourse heuristics are a key to helping students become critically literate in a digital age” (p. 75) because they “Focus student attention in a decidedly politicized fashion.” A metadiscourse heuristic for examining
                    digital writing environments can help students identify the socio-political exigencies that lead to manufacturing digital disinformation and reflect on how and why disinformation works and who it benefits and who it harms. The examination
                    of disinformation tactics provided in this webtext serves as one example of a metadiscourse heuristic that can help audiences identify and investigate digital disinformation. Audiences need to approach digital literacy acquisition
                    with a social and political awareness, and teachers need to spend more time questioning how technologies are used to manipulate and exploit people and less time on how to use them. The greatest concern in the disinformation era is
