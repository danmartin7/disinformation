          <h1>Constructing the Fauxpert</h1>
          <p>
            <i>As long as we believe that we deal with the ends and means in the political realm, we shall not be able to prevent anybody's using all means to pursue recognized ends.</i>
            <br>Hannah Arendt</br>
          </p>
          <p>In this section I examine how the SPN hires experts and professionals with advanced degrees to write articles, commentaries, and misleading research reports for its websites. University faculty and professional experts who use their authority and credentials to write and publish disinformation are what I term <i>fauxperts</i>. Fauxperts lend their credibility to the SPN, bolstering an illusion of trustworthiness for a disinformation network. Blending opinion and disinformation together allows fauxperts to intimidate less educated and inexperienced audiences who are hesistant to question experts out of fear of being wrong and embarassed or ridiculed. No one likes to admit that they are ignorant. A primary contribution fauxperts make to the SPN is generating and promoting <a href="homegrown.html">homegrown evidence</a> and endorsing misleading claims for SPN affiliates. They use their ethos to promote and advance arguments that fall well outside their expertise and speciality. Fauxperts also use <a hreh="imitating.">genres</a> typically reserved for delivering highly credible information and research to academic and professional communities. Manufacturing fake scholarship and research to support unsubstantiated claims can manipulate audiences and slow down their ability to verify information quickly. Most of the content fauxperts produce for the SPN is outside of their field of expertise; it's simply the expert's opinion couched as expertise. University faculty and professionals are more than aware of the unethicality of lending their credentials to support arguments that are beyond the scope of their expertise. For example, in “When Red State Governors Act Like Blue,” an article published by the <i>
              <a href="https://inpolicy.org/2020/05/moss-when-red-state-governors-act-like-blue/" target="_blank">Indiana Policy Review</a>
            </i>, Dr. Richard Moss, a surgeon, makes outlandish claims about Covid. </p>
          <p>In this example, Moss is using his credibility as a doctor to advance a series of stereotypes, tropes, and bigoted opinions for a questionable journal. The quality of research and the standards and methodologies required for argumentation within educated communities is not the same quality we find from fauxperts, but the presence of their credentials inside a so-called journal gives the claims authority. Even though the journal's tone and language do not meet the expectations and standards for traditional academic and professional journal essays, many audiences won't know the difference. When academic faculty and professional researchers design disinformation, using specific genres, they create additional layers of disinformation that are more difficult for audiences to identify, analyze, and pull apart. Certain genres have structures and forms that are epistemic, that represent knowledge making, regardless of the content. Fauxperts use these genres to produce and endorse claims that bolster the SPN's credibility. Expertise is a foundational requirement for academic and professional research publications. The fauxpert is a mouthpiece for the SPN, someone who filters and sanitizes disinformation. The <i>Indiana Policy Review</i> hired Dr. Moss to make false claims about covid without providing any scientific or medical evidence. They are appropriating his credentials to bolster disinformation about Covid. Using one's medical credentials to disguise an opinion as sound medical advice in a fake research journal is unethical and perilous. Calling the <i>Indiana Policy Review</i> a journal is also highly misleading and suspect. For example, in another article titled <a href="https://inpolicy.org/2020/04/moss-armageddon-for-red-china/" target="_blank">“Armageddon for Red China”</a> Dr. Moss perpetuates a conspiracy theory about China deliberately manufacturing Covid in a lab and spreading it around the world on purpose. He refers to Covid as the Chinese Virus, amplifying racist and derogatory conspiracy theories about Covid that are currently being promoted on the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/lab-leak-true-origins-of-covid-19/" target="_blank"> White House website</a>, expanding the network's message. The CDC has continually reiterated the dangers of using hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid, but Musk and the Trump administration are currently gutting the CDC and replacing health communication with disinformation. The SPN has become a mouthpiece and lobbyist for the current adminstration's agenda. </p>
          <p> The Pioneer Institute (PI) provides a <a href="https://pioneerinstitute.org/academic-advisors/" target="_blank">list of fauxperts</a> on its website to bolster its credibility and construct the illusion that the PI consults with a team of objective academic and professional researchers. Below is a list of experts who contribute to the PI, but I was unable to find any contributions to the PI from anyone on the list in figure 2. Providing names of experts on the website manufactures a presence of expertise on the website that keeps most users from checking to see if or how these experts contribute to the PI.

          </p>
          <p>The Buckeye Institute (BI) also hires experts with advanced degrees to produce fake economic research. Having a fauxpert write a fake journal article or research report forms several layers of distortion users can't always see. Fauxperts like <a href="https://www.buckeyeinstitute.org/experts/detail/Andrew-J-Kidd" target="_blank"> Andrew Kidd</a> help construct an image of credibility for the SPN that doesn't really exist. The BI is not an academic institution or university, or a research institute like the Jet Propulsion Lab. It is a pseudo-research institution, pseudo-policy forum, and pseudo-foundation that hires well-educated people like Kidd to generate and endorse disinformation. The BI is also appropriating itself with Ohio's flagship university, Ohio State University, to manufacture an association with a research institution that doesn't exist. These layers of illusion impair audiences' ability to discern fact from fiction. When audiences visit SPN websites and see that the writers and researchers have advanced degrees, or that a writer is affiliated with a prestigious research university like Notre Dame, they are likely to relax their critical faculties and habits of mind and become more willing to trust that source. Fauxperts deactivate someone's critical habits of mind and make them overlook problematic content because it is from an expert, but expertise is specific and not general. </p>
          <p>In an article in the <i>
              <a href="https://inpolicy.org/2020/04/gaski-the-medias-macabre-dance/" target="_blank">Indiana Policy Review Journal</a>
            </i>, John F. Gaski, a business professor from Notre Dame, argues that Trump's claims about the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine were scientifically valid and posed no danger to the public, even though this professor's Ph.D. is in business and not virology. Audiences need to check how an expert's specialization aligns with the arguments and claims they make and determine if their expertise extends beyond a disciplinary boundary. Gaski's credentials and affiliation with a prestigious unviersity enhances baseless and perilous claims about an ineffective and dangerous treatment for Covid. Dr. Gaski's rant about hydroxychloroquine lacks evidentiary support and recklessly advances a dangerous conspiracy theory about the effectiveness of a drug that the vast majority of the medical community definitively argues is deadly. </p>

          </p>
          <p> Furthermore, many people who read Graski's article will see his credentials, trust his ethos, and relax their critical habits of mind. Several readers will never even realize his expertise is in business and not medicine. Reading a journal article comes with an assumption that the author and content have been verified, so a fake journal article and a fauxpert create two additional layers of disinformation that have to be peeled back and exposed. Many readers rely on traditional markers of credibility like the author's education and expertise to determine the honesty of a piece of information, and to make decisions about its value. Someone reading this journal article, written by an expert from a prestigious univeristy, might overlook that Graski makes baseless claims on issues outside of his expertise. It's troubling that a business professor from the University of Notre Dame is amplifying a conspiracy theory about the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for a nonprofit disinformation network. </p>
          <p>In the era of disinformation, everyone needs to be able to verify expertise in digital sources. Fauxperts like Gaski, Moss, and Kidd write research documents on issues outside of their expertise and pass them off as credible scholarship and research on SPN websites. Accounting for how expertise is established in digital writing environments is an important technical literacy for recognizing disinformation. Hiring people with advanced degrees to produce pseudo-scholarship and faux-academic research and spread it across a disinformation network is eroding democracy. Every SPN website provides a list of fauxperts who have earned PhD's, graduate degrees, or MD's, and who lend their expertise to a disinformation network. Knowing how to verify expertise in digital writing environments, seeing how expertise can lend credibility to a disinformation network, is a form of crap detection. Moving forward, Americans need to regain control of local and national media outlets and rebuild a healthy information ecosystem: <a href="conclusion.html">conclusion</a>. </p>
