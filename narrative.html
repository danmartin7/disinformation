          <h1>The Narrative</h1>
          <p>
            <i>Most words and deeds are about some wordly objective reality in addition to being a disclosure of the acting and speaking agent.</i>
            <br>Hannah Arendt</br>
          </p>
          <p>The SPN affiliates work together “in coordinated efforts to push their agenda, often using the same cookie-cutter research and reports” (The Center for Media and Democracy, p. 1) to imitate professional genres and enhance their credibility. SPN websites contain thousands of sources and documents that construct a very specific and repeatable narrative that supports a set of core issues. The Center for Media and Democracy's report discloses that the SPN upholds and supports an “extreme right-wing agenda,” and that every member of the SPN promotes legislation “to privatize education, block healthcare reform, restrict workers' rights, roll back environmental protections, and create a tax system that benefits mostly those at the very top level of income” (p. 1). The SPN disinplatforms also support limiting voting rights and eliminating taxes for the wealthy and state pensions. All the websites I analyzed provided disinformation about privatizing education, busting unions, lowering minimum wage, building suburban megacities, and oppossing global warmining. The Georgia Public Policy Foundation (GPPF) uses its website's navigation bar to organize content around the SPN core issues.</p>

          <p>The <a href="SPNandALEC.html"> SPN affiliates</a> vigirously promote the same neoliberal policies and provide support and evidence for these values on their websites. The redundancy of this agenda forms a strong layer in the disinformation network. Every one of these policies has become a realization under the current adminstration. In hindsight, these webistes have promoted the same disinformation currently coming out of the White House and US federal government. The redundancy and repetition of the SPN narrative across all the affiliate websites sends a unified message that grinds down on audiences. </p>
          <p> Having over 64 different organizations promote the same message assumes that there is broad support for the ideas presented in the message. The repetition of messages across platforms gives them an authority and relevance even if they have a minority of support. The websites advance the same narrative to facilitate the appearance of a wide range of support for a set of selected issues. In fact, I was unable to locate any information on any of the websites that addressed a topic outside of its core issues. March (2010) reminds us that “Credibility thrives on familiarity” and not on truth or facts (p. 56). When people hear and see the same messages over and over, they start to believe them. They begin to trust what they have been conditioned to see and hear, irregardless of the credibity of the information. <span id="dots"></span>
            <span id="more"> For example, the Arkansas Policy Foundation (APF) <a href="http://www.arkansaspolicyfoundation.org/" target="_blank">website</a> “analyzes the impact of public policy on Arkansas and makes recommendations” on tax policies and education reform. <a href="https://yankeeinstitute.org/" target="_blank"> The Yankee Institute</a> (YI), an SPN affiliate in Connecticut, “develops and advances free-market, limited-government solutions in Connecticut. As one of America's oldest state-based think tanks, YI is a leading advocate for smart, limited government; fairness for taxpayers; and an open road to opportunity.” <a href="https://alaskapolicyforum.org/" target="_blank">The Alaska Policy</a> Forum's mantra states, “Our vision is an Alaska that continuously grows prosperity by maximizing individual opportunities and freedom.” Repetition helps triangulate this narrative.

          <P>The Texas Public Policy Foundation uses the same layout to organize the SPN's target issues on its website's navigation bar as the GPPF.</P>

          <p>SPN websites contain hundreds of articles addressing issues from anti-grocery bag taxes to anti-union and anti-teacher pension laws. For example, the articles on the California Policy Center's (CPC) website extend SPN disinformation narratives on anti-union and anti-homelessness, public school limitations, voting rights, and the value of protecting business interests and property rights. On the CPC <a href="https://californiapolicycenter.org/" target="_blank">website's</a> education page, someone can read articles filled with disinformation about how “Public Education Is Changing” and “School Choice Ascending.” Audiences will be exposed to misleading information about “The Coming Upheaval in Education,” “Rethinking Diversity Bureaucrats," and "Rethinking College Education.” Hundreds of articles published on this website spin the same narrative and employ every disinformation tactic I found in this study: <a href="fauxperts.html">fauxperts</a>, <a href="homegrown.html">homegrown</a> evidence, <a href="imitating.html">imitation</a>, and <a href="impairment.html">impairment</a>. The SPN also uses disclaimers to avoid legal backlash and accusations of lobbying because it is illegal to use a nonprofit to lobby for industry. SPN members like the Pacific Research Institute (PRI) provide a disclaimer that emphasizes that it does not support the views of its own publications. For example, the PRI <a href="https://www.pacificresearch.org/" target="_blank">website</a> states, “Nothing contained in this blog is to be construed as necessarily reflecting the views of Pacific Research Institute or as an attempt to thwart or aid the passage of any legislation.” Disclaimers like this can be found on all of the <a href="spnwebsites.html">SPN websites</a> to avoid lawsuits for disinformation and illegal lobbying. </p>
