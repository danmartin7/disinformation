          <h1>Impairment</h1>
          <p>
            <i>It is quite conceivable that the modern age &ndash;which began with such a promising outburst of human activity&ndash;may end in the deadliest, most sterile passivity history has ever known.</i>
            <br>Hannah Arendt</br>
          </p>
          <p>In this section, I examine how the SPN impairs users and I note how to identify disinformation in digital writing environments. Seeing more examples of what disinformation looks like and how it does what it does is important for expanding critical digital literacies. A disinformation network's main goal is to impair people from making a sound decision or thinking for themselves. Again, many of the webpages I examined for this project were taken down or removed after they served a purpose. A large amount of disinformation I encountered on these websites appeared for a short time in an attempt to alter public opinion for an upcoming election or local decision. The most common disinformation tactics for impairing audiences that I found were:
          <ul>
            <li>failing to provide references or links to locate sources,</li>
            <li>labeling SPN affiliates as foundations, institutes, or policy groups,</li>
            <li>using a nonprofit status, </li>
            <li>creating and citing <a href="homegrown.html">homegrown</a> research, </li>
            <li>
              <a href="datadump.html">dumping</a> ambigious data,
            </li>
            <li>and <a href="imitating.html">mimicking</a> professional and academic genres. </li>
          </ul> In this section, I focus on examining the first three impairment strategies. Each of the last three strategies has its own page of analysis. The 503(c)(3) nonprofit status forms an intitial layer, a first-layer, of manufactured credibility and it helps the SPN hide its biased and political intentions. A nonprofit status signals to audiences that the information on SPN websites is credible because it's not for profit, but correlating a non profit to honesty has been untrue for decades. Nonprofit organizations have implemented a range of donation systems to collect large amounts of money to produce disinformation and avoid paying taxes. Moreover, labeling SPN affiliates as foundations, institutes, or policy groups manufactures another layer of credibility that keeps audiences from questioning the sincerity of the content on the websites. These terms are associated with a culture and tradition of officiality and authority that leads people away from making assumptions about what these organizations actually do. When people believe information comes from a nonprofit foundation or a credible organization, they are more likley to relax their critical habits of mind. A nonprofit foundation or institute can signal to audiences that the information they produce and share are not politically or financially motivated and do not promote extreme political and social bias. However, people are abusing nonprofit status to manipulate audiences. No one should be able to use a nonprofit status to prevent or limit people from noticing disinformation. Everyone needs to approach a nonprofit organization with some skepticism before learning more about its motives. The SPN also uses fake references to disinform audiences. </p>
          <p>The SPN deliberately complicates its audiences' ability to verify sources in its publications. Obfuscating source material forces audiences to either trust the content or spend extra time and energy verifying it, which, in some circumstances, can take hours, days, or even weeks to complete. In other words, it's a designed waste of time. I spent just over 100 hours verifiying sources on SPN websites for this project. Making audiences locate where data in a chart came from or who wrote a source is a disinformation tactic students must learn to recognize. It's unethical to ask audiences to verify the existence of sources in a digital writing enviornment. One of the first examples of impairment I provide comes from an article on the Georgia Public Policy Committee's (GPCC) website that references an unsourced graph to inaccurately correlate the presence and absence of polar bears with climate change. Harold Brown references several sources and even provides quotes in the article, but he does not provide any links or citations for readers to verify those sources. The graph states “Various Sources” at the top of the page but the article does not provide any information about those sources or identify any of the sources referenced in the article. It also fails to provide a bibliography or works cited page so users can easily locate and verify sources. Failing to provide an efficient way to locate sources is a common characteristic of disinformation. Below is a screenshot of and link to the graph and article:</p>

          </p>
          <p> The article mentions a report from the First International Meeting on the Polar Bear in 1967 in Alaska, but there is no way to verify this source, and <a href="http://pbsg.npolar.no/export/sites/pbsg/en/docs/PBSG00proc.pdf" target="_blank">the report</a> is from 1967. I located the report online after searching for it on Google. The report is over 84 pages and Brown's does not provide page numbers in his references and I was unable to locate the quote Brown referenced to the report in the article. Brown blends confusing data and outdated research and then fails to provide links and references to slow down audiences' ability to verify his claims. It would take someone several hours to verify this source, which is an overwhelming time committment. This is an indication that Brown is using citations and resources in his article to disinform. Audiences should be concenrned with references to outdated articles and a lack of an efficient method to verify sources. Taking the time to provide source verification in digital writing environments is a deliberate attempt to prevent disinformation. </p>
          <p> Brown also references a research article on tropical atolls to inaccurately correlate an increase in island size with a lack of global warming. He uses the article to insist that if global warming were occurring, islands would be decreasing in size; however, Brown must not have read the article he cited in his report because it very clearly accounts for other physical transformations occurring on the island as a result of global warming. The article that Brown relies on to make his argument actually concludes that the measurement for erosion on some parts of the island can “be offset by accretion on parts of the coastline” (Webb & Kench, 2010), and that accretion can give the illusion that erosion is minimal when, in fact, it is significant but less noticeable, considering the total size of the island. Brown's reference to a 43% increase in island formation is taken from the article's abstract on the first page. Had he read the entire article, he would have found that "assessments of island change must be evaluated at the 'whole island' scale involving analysis of potential change in the entire island perimeter” ( <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921818110001013" target="_blank">(Webb & Kench</a>, 2010) and not just at one part of the island. Coastal erosion is not representative of the whole island's total erosion. Most people don't have time to verify this information. Using sea level data on a select set of locations to falsely represent global sea level rising is disinformation. Referencing 14 specific locations that have unique land formations that experience a variety of effects from global warming, locations that are very different from other land formations, and then using those 14 locations to represent global warming erosion is misleading. </p>
          <p> It took me over five hours to read this article and vett Brown's article, sources, and claims. Brown cites scientific jargon from a journal article to give the illusion that he synthesized research into his article. Checking the references in an opaque digital source is vital for locating disinformation. Audiences need to learn how disinformation networks use credible sources that are out of context and do not have a succinct connection to the argument. The presence or use of a credible reference is not enough to determine that its interjection is fair and honest or directly connected to the argument. Teaching students how to check if for source interjection in digital writing environments is important for discovering disinformation. Audiences should be suspcious of references that fail to provide the title or the author of the source, the title of the publication outlet, or a reference or works cited page to locate sources quickly. Slowing down the ability to verify information requires very little effort to design and execute in digital writing environments. In print publications, there are more opportunities to review and prevent content from publication. Impairing someone's ability to verify digital sources erodes democracy at an unprecedented rate. Democratic communication systems require efficient methods and practices for validating information in a timely manner. The Independence Institute is another SPN affiliate that fails to provide verifiable evidence for its claims in a published report on arming teachers.</p>
          <p>In <a href="https://i2i.org/wp-content/uploads/FASTER_Myths.pdf" target="_blank">Busting Myths</a>, the author asserts that all teachers carry guns outside of school, disarm themselves every day for work, and then immediately rearm themselves when they get to the car after work, inferring that teachers will not mind carrying a gun in the classroom and protecting students. But there is no evidence to support this claim. The report also predicts that an overwhelming number of teachers would be willing to volunteer to carry a gun in the classroom, but it does not offer any evidence to support that claim. Research on arming teachers maintains that a majority of national and state school boards oppose arming teachers, and many national and state surveys that ask teachers if they would carry a gun on campus have definitively shown that teachers emphatically do not want to carry a gun on campus or in the classroom. A California State University professor conducted a <a href="https://www.csun.edu/sites/default/files/What%20Do%20the%20Teachers%20Want_White%20Paper.pdf" target="_blank">study</a> on arming teachers in schools and found that less than 15% of teachers even owned a gun, and that over 90% of teachers did not want to carry a gun in the classroom. The article on busting myths is actually creating one. Audiences should be aware of sources without references and citations in digital writing environments. This type of distortion of sources is common on SPN websites. There are hundreds of documents on SPN websites that disseminate disinformation in this same way. </p>
          <p>The Goldwater Institute (GI), out of Arizona, writes and publishes hundreds of reports that promote SPN target issues. In the <a href="https://indefenseofliberty.blog/2020/04/07/rage-against-the-chloroquine/" target="_blank">"Rage against Chloroquine,"</a> Mark Flatten cites medical evidence from the <i>NY Post</i> and references several questionable websites to support his claims. He also fails to cite any medical scholarship or peer-reviewed research on hydroxychloroquine. Flatten's article asserts that the medical community has no idea how hyrdroxychloroquine effects humans or how effective the drug is, or can be, to treat Covid; however, the medical community has consistently asked the general public not to use hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid because it is dangerous. All of the sources referenced in Flatten's article are questionable and require verification. The time required to verify these sources is overwhelming. I spent hours searching for sources. Many users will likely trust these references because they come from fauxperts, and they're woven into professional and <a href="imitating.html">academic genres</a> that reduce audiences' desire to verify them. Even though doctors have a long, historical understanding of hydroxychloroquine and its effects on humans, Flatten argues that hydroxychloroquine is the “most promising” drug for treating Covid but he does not provide evidence to support that claim. This article's disinformation on hydroxychloroquine bolsters existing narratives about the effectiveness of drug that many politicians pushed in press conferences in 2020 at the height of Covid. The trusted medical community and the CDC, before the current Trump administration took it over, continually noted the dangers of using the drug to treat Covid. The webpage has been removed. The CDC also released a report that claimed hydroxychloroquine is not only ineffective for treating Covid but it is lethal to humans. In 2025, the CDC was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-hhs-cdc-fda-nih-cms-layoffs-5aba829b829d9e1a0167c4a0d968aadb" target="_blank">defunded</a> and thousands of employees were fired by Elon Musk and DOGE in a massive government purge. The disinformation narratives on SPN websites are slowly making their way into the federal government. The link to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/therapeutic-options.html" target="_blank"> CDC</a> webpage about using hydroxychloroquine from 2020 has been removed. The current administration is attempting to make it harder for US citizens to access and locate scientific evidence about Covid. </p>
          <p>The Commonwealth Foundation, an SPN affiliate out of Pennsylvania, hired a marketing firm to conduct surveys on reopening the economy during Covid in 2020. 74% of respondents supported a move to reopen the state after the Covid shutdown. 40% of respondents somewhat agreed and 34% of respondents strongly agreed. Below is a link and screenshot of the graph. </p>

          </p>
          <p>There are several questions left unanswered in this survey that students need to learn how to ask. The marketing firm polled 500 people, but who were these people? The article claims that voters were polled, but we don't know anything about the demographics of the respondents for the survey, and we don't know where and when the poll was conducted. The article states that the firm administered the poll across the state, but it does not provide the name of any of the cities and counties where polling took place. When users click on the link for the summary of the poll results, they are taken to the results of a completely different poll on Pennsylvanians' top priorities. If someone fails to pay close attention to these polls and links, they will miss the sleight of hand. The CWF relies on the results of another unmentioned poll to further suggest that the residents approve of opening the state as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>Audiences have to click on two different links on the CWF website to access the right poll data, forcing someone to track down references and verify data. Below is an image and link to the poll questions and data:</p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p> Furthermore, the poll on jobs and the economy does not ask respondents if they want to reopen the economy during a pandemic. Ironically, this poll claims that voters see healthcare as a top priority and opening up the economy too early during a pandemic would threaten the community's health, a stark contradiction. The CWF is trying to use two different polls to support a claim that neither poll can support on its own. These two questionable polls look credible on the surface but they cannot be verified. In the methodology section there is a link to the poll results and survey report, but the survey report only provides the percentages of survey responses, which further obfuscates how users read the data. Instead of providing the total number of votes for each question, the article provides percentages so the responses appear to have a greater sense of value. The survey also claims that the poll represents a range of respondents (35% democrat, 33% republican, and 31% independent), but how were these survey-takers targeted? Does this political demographic constitute the political makeup of the state? How were these voters contacted? Phone? Email? The lack of transparency is a form of impairment that signals that something is amiss with the information in the publication. </p>
          <p>In addition to not disclosing who was surveyed, the method's section does provide the questions respondents were asked. The data collection methodology used a non-probability-based opt in but it also uses probability sampling. This research jargon symbolizes the presence of expertise even if these terms confuse lay audiences or are applied inadequately. Without an explanation of these terms and how they apply to this study and data set, audiences are left to misinterpret the data. </p>

          <p>The use of dense lexis can also prevent people from asking clarifying questions for fear of looking or feeling ignorant. Making people feel inferior is a disinformation tactic that prevents people from questioning misleading or confusing content. The method's section mentions conducting online interviews, but it fails to provide details about how, when, and where those interviews were conducted. The article claims the results of the interviews were weighed on demographics that are never actually provided. The CWF stated that it conducted interviews with over 1000 people, but we never learn about the demographics of that population, so audiences are left to either trust the survey or spend additional time learning more about it. </p>
          <p>The Platte Institute (PI) uses a blueprint document that contains questionable and obscure research references and citations to support its claims. Figure 5 provides examples of vaugue references and ambiguous data visualizations inside the blueprint. </p>
          <p>

          <p>Figure 5: PI Website. Poor Reference Quality. 6-9-2020. </center>
          </p>
          <p>The list of references in the PI's report and the data in the pie charts are problematic. The report cites essays, blog posts, and podcasts but these sources are missing dates, author names, and publication outlets. Hiding where sources orginated in a digital writing environment is a disinformation tactic. Imitating the structures and forms of professional and academic genres and using misleading references creates dense layers of disinformation that audiences have to unravel. </p>
          <p>The Buckeye Institute (BI) writes a policy memo to encourage using telehealth because it benefits people who have low mobility and live far from medical care. However, the references in the memo used to support these claims are disconnected. For example, the <a href="https://www.buckeyeinstitute.org/library/docLib/2020-04-29-The-Buckeye-Institute-Offers-a-Roadmap-to-Reopen-Ohio-Safely-policy-memo.pdf" target="_blank">reference</a> about people with “low-mobility” benefiting from telehealth specifically addresses homebound patients with depression who need psychotherapy (Buckeye Institute). The reference supporting the claim that people who “live far” away from medical care benefit from telehealth is from an article about specialized pediatric care in rural communities, which falls outside the scope of the claims, and it fails to address the benefits of telehealth more broadly. The title of one of the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/da.22242" target="_blank">article's</a> referenced in the memo is “Six-Month Postintervention Depression and Disability Outcomes of In-Home Telehealth Problem-Solving Therapy for Depressed, Low-Income Homebound Older Adults,” and the other article is from a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/pr2015192" target="_blank">pediatric's journal</a>. Telehealth for children with special needs who live in rural areas is not a typical patient population, nor does it represent the total population or reflect how children with special needs as a patient population would typically use telehealth. Homebound depressed patients who need psychotherapy are also not a representation of general patient care. Having access to healthcare has been a problem for these specific patients before and after Covid, so using these sources to address telehealth in relation to the pandemic and this specific patient population is misleading. Misconnecting and misrepresenting source material is a disinformation tactic designed to impair one's critical thinking. The artifical connectivity between the references and the claims in a report with graphs and statistics manifests the illusion of credibility. The structures of a genre like a report evoke a desire to recognize those structures. "Genres have this generative power because they maintain the desires that elicit their use—socially sanctioned motives for 'appropriately' recognizing and behaving within certain recurring situations" (Bawarshi, p. 96). The patterns of genres are alluring because they call us to join them, to engage and complete their meaning. </p>
          <p>In the same report, the BI contends that businesses should have reopened sooner during the pandemic and that restaurants could have served guests outdoors because people were safer when they were outside. The reference that supports this claim, however, argues that when people are outside, they should keep moving and not stay still. The title and focus of the source are connected to the claim, but the reference's argument undermines the memo instead of bolstering it. The title of the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/01/825143172/just-keep-moving-and-sometimes-double-your-distance" target="_blank"> NPR</a> article referenced in the report is “Just Keep Moving. And Sometimes, Double Your Distance.” This article argues that people are less likely to contract Covid when they are outside, but only if they're moving and socially distanced, which directly undermines the BI's report to open up restaurants for patrons to sit and eat outside. The use of source references that appear to support a claim but do not is a disinformation tactic that slows down users from vetting the references because it requires significant effort. Developing the perseverance to interrogate digital sources is vital in the disinformation age. Being able to locate and verify disinformation requires patiences and diligence. </p>
          <p>Pam Lewson, from the Washington Policy Center (WPC), proclaimed that her research found that "the application of Chlorpyrifos” as a pesticide in Washington “is extremely safe" and has been used in the state safely for years, but she fails to cite any research to support this claim. </p>

          </p>
          <p>Lewson's unsupported claims about the safety of Chlorpyrifos are dangerous. A basic search on chlorpyrifos reveals the significant dangers of this pesticide and the many attempts to ban it because of its direct links to cancer and other health concerns in humans. The <i>Baltimore Sun</i> reported that “The Children's Environmental Health and Protection Advisory Council firmly supports legislation in the 2020 Maryland General Assembly that would ban the toxic pesticide chlorpyrifos.” <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/howard/cng-ho-letters-0220-20200219-wsi5vx37zfaupkfspmtybrf7iu-story.html" target="_blank">The Baltimore Sun</a> insisted that “A wealth of science demonstrates adverse health effects of chlorpyrifos exposure to developing fetuses, infants, children and pregnant women.” The Oregon Attorney General also <a href="https://www.doj.state.or.us/media-home/news-media-releases/oregon-sues-epa-over-toxic-pesticide-in-food/" target="_blank">reported</a> that “Chlorpyrifos has been well-documented to harm proper development and functioning of the central nervous system and brain.” The evidence on the dangers of chlorpyrifos is significant. In a <i>Pediatrics</i>
            <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17116700/" target="_blank">article</a>, several doctors found that children exposed to chlorpyrifos “scored lower on the Bayley Psychomotor Development Index” and “the Bayley Mental Development Index at 3 years of age compared with those with lower levels of exposure” (Raugh et al., 2006). Doctors also found that children exposed to higher levels of chlorpyrifos were “more likely to experience Psychomotor Development Index and Mental Development Index delays, attention problems, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder problems, and pervasive developmental disorder problems at 3 years of age” (Raugh et al., 2006). The SPN and Lewson are creating, publishing, and circulating disinformation that is highly dangerous to the general public's health. Even the company that makes chlorpyrifos, <a href="https://beyondpesticides.org/dailynewsblog/2020/02/major-manufacturer-of-chlorpyrifos-drops-out-of-market-but-epa-continues-to-allow-use/" target="_blank">Corteva</a>, decided to halt production in 2019 because of the dangers the chemical posed to the public, yet it is still legal to use despite these health ramifications.

          <p>The EPA banned the use of chlorpyrifos in building construction and attempted to ban its use in the US in 2016, but the Trump adminstration halted the ban. The EPA also attempted to ban the use of chlorpyrifos on crops, but Scott Pruitt, the EPA Director at the time of this research, wrote an order that postponed a final decision on chlorpyrifos until the end of 2022. The current administration in 2025 is also limiting the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/epa-science-layoffs-trump-doge-8a5743b9281e3f82afdf2cdd5f972d5f" target="_blank">EPA's</a> ability to regulate chemicals and products and defunding federal programs that generate health and science data. The US is currently experiencing a more formal dismantling of health expertise across federal and state institutions. The Trump administration is cutting NIH funding for science and health research and propping and sanitizing disinformation about vaccines, floruide, and autism. RFK jr., a conspiracy theorist, former herion addict, eugenicist, and anti vaxxer who does not have a medical degree or experience, has <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/trump-administration-purges-u-s-health-agency-leaders" target="_blank">purged</a> several respected health experts from the Health and Human Services department and replaced them with supporters of pseudo science. </p>
          <p>Impairment is an extremely effective and foundational disinformation tactic. If misleading information can appear authentic and credible, users might trust the information. If the content <a href="imitating.html">imitates</a> or mimics professional and academic genres, some users may not feel compelled enough to verify content and references. Slowing someone's verification process down or eliminating it all together is an effective disinformation tactic because it does not require a mounumental effort to achieve. Ong et al. (2018) affirmed that many times “Trust overrides deceptive intent” (p. 59), and if users trust the SPN and its affiliates, they will trust its content, never noticing the disinformation. An example of how this works happened with Rhianna and her fans. Rhianna accidentally shared a <a href="https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/rihanna-shares-fake-photo-of-australia-fires-after-it-breaks-internet" target="_blank">misleading</a> tweet during the Australian fires and most of her followers spread the tweet without thinking twice about the content because they trust her, and this trust kept them from contemplating whether or not the content of her tweet was questionable. Knowing that Rhianna is capable of getting duped into sharing disinformation will not stop her followers from trusting her in the future, either. Even if Rhianna began to willingly share disinformation, many of her fans would still share it because they will always trust her. This is true for organizations like the SPN and populists like Trump. Many supporters of the SPN do not consider the validity of the SPN's content because they trust the network's values and goals. The ends justifies the means. </p>
