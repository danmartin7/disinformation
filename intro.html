          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>
            <i>A noticeable decrease in common sense in any given community and a noticeable increase in superstition and gullibility are therefore almost infallible signs of alienation from the world.</i>
            <br> Hannah Arendt</br>

          <p>The United States is currently living in an unprecedented age of digital disinformation and everyone desperately needs more methods to read, listen, watch, and interpret media content in digital writing environments. One significant finding in my research on digital disinformation is that politically active organizations are using nonprofit 503(c)(3) status to start pseudo media companies in each state that design and circulate misleading content across dozens of websites, structuring and forming a massive disinformation network. These organizations use the affordances of digital writing environments to publish click-bait headlines, distracting images and graphs, fraudulent primary research, anonymous and fake sourcing, and populist rhetoric (Holiday, 2012, p. 63-64). These tactics generate layers of disinformation that are extraordinarly complicated to unravel. Using one disinformation tactic alone, one layer, may have a limited effect on an audience but layers of disinformation tactics can strengthen an illusion of truth that is difficult to undermine. Anderson and Sayers (2015) posit that "Layers afford precisely that opportunity for unpacking the ambiguous (dis)continuities, versions, and relational pressure points" (p. 82) that make disinformation difficult to see, hear, or recognize when first encountering it. Layering disinformation puts audiences in "multiphrenetic" states where they can remain confused and disoriented for long periods of time, if not idefinitely (Gergen, 1991, p. 16). Disinformation saturation erodes self-confidence and self-identity, forcing people to constantly second guess themselves. There has been significant research on analyzing misleading content in digital writing environments (Charney, 2001; Karpf, 2019; Jenkins, 2008; Jowett & O'Donell, 2019; Lazer, et al., 2018; Martin, 2020; Marwick & Lewis, 2017), but there has been less attention paid to analyzing disinformation networks and providing specific examples of disinformation tactics across a wide range of genres, modes, and mediums. </p>
          <p>This webtext examines how the State Policy Network (<a href="thespn.html">SPN</a>) uses digital writing enviornments to manufacture a massive network of disinformation across the US. This webtext also outlines how to recognize and interrogate networked platforms that publish and circulate disinformation. It also outlines several critical literacies (Craig, 2017; Miller & Leon, 2017; Selber, 2004; Selfe, 1998; Ong, 2002; Sindoni & Moschini, 2022) that <a href="exigence.html">frame</a> the analysis of digital writing environments, platforms, and networks. The <a href="thespn.html">SPN</a> is an alt-right think tank, primarily financied by the Koch brothers, that designs and spreads disinformation across a network of websites in all 50 states. According to <a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Portal:State_Policy_Network" target="_blank">Sourcewatch.org</a>, there are over 160 members in the SPN working under a 503(c)(3) nonprofit status. For this webtext, I analyzed how <a href="SPNwebsites.html">64 SPN affiliates</a> design and spread misleading information on websites. I used McNely and Teston's (2015) approach to "field work" as a methodology to mark and code disinformation tactics I found on the websites. After collecting hundreds of pages of notes and hundreds of screenshots of web content for analysis (McNely & Teston's, 2015, p. 117), I coded and analyzed the most commonly used disinformation tactics I found on the SPN websites. I also kept track of the time and labor required to vett sources and determine the presence of disinformation on the websites. I wanted to know how much time it was taking to identify and disentangle each disinformation tactic. Increasing the labor and time needed to verify sources is the main aim of the disinformation tactics I uncovered. It is also important to emphasize that disinformation networks erractically delete, move, or replace content without notice. The SPN has relocated or deleted hundreds of webpages since I started this project in 2020. Even though I have checked links and references made to SPN content, any of these materials can disappear at any given moment. </p>
          <p>Below is a list of the most common and reoccurring disinformation tactics I found across the 64 websites I examined over three years. These tactics require a range of digital literacies to recognize and disentangle. Explore these tactics in any order; many of them overlap and are connected:

            <li>
              <a href="impairment.html">
                <strong>Impairment</strong>
              </a> drastically slows down a user's ability to validate source material quickly. Every disinformation tactic on a SPN website is designed to impair the audience and make it more cumbersome to verify content. Obfuscating where sources come from and how they're made makes it too time consuming for audiences to vett information.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="homegrown.html">
                <strong>Homegrown</strong>
              </a> research is funded, created, and published by the SPN but disguised as objective, peer-reviewed research. The SPN conducts its own primary research (surveys, interviews, graphs, charts) to compete with more credible, well-established facts in scientific and professional research communities. Homegrown research is pseudo research that serves the interests of the SPN and helps it manifest an appearance of a credible publication network.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="imitating.html">
                <strong>Imitating</strong>
              </a> professional and academic genres allows the SPN to disguise disinformation and confuse audiences. The SPN mimics the structures and forms of professional and academic genres and discourse to produce disinformation across its websites.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="fauxpert.html">
                <strong>Fauxperts</strong>
              </a> help disinformation organizations manufacture a professional ethos that doesn't exist. The SPN hires experts with advanced and terminal degrees to enhance its credibility. Fauxperts pose as experts in a field outside of their expertise, and they disguise their opinions and anecdotes inside the structures and forms of professional genres.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="datadump.html">
                <strong>Data dumps</strong>
              </a> form spaces for audiences to disinform themselves. Large sets of acontextual data can leave audiences baffled and confused. The SPN publishes and shares acontextual data without a frame to interpret the data.
            </li>
            <li>Reiterating the same <a href="narrative.html">
                <strong>narrative</strong>
              </a> on all the SPN websites instantiates a massive echo chamber. The constant and redundant discussion of topics on anti-immigration, global warming skepticism, and privatizing education across its websites forms the foundation of the SPN echo chamber. A consistent narrative across platforms triangulates and enables disinformation. </li>
            <li>The SPN shields its disinformation behind a <strong>nonprofit 503(c)(3)</strong>. A nonprofit status creates the first layer of distortion that alludes to the SPN as a beacon of trust and a symbol of honesty. </li>
          </ol>
          <p>The primary finding from this study is that SPN affiliates use websites to disguise disinformation in professional and academic genres. Slowing down the ability to locate and verify sources is a primary aim of the SPN's disinformation network. Asking audiences to spend excessive time verifying content forces them to trust the content if it aligns with their political motives and ideals. The SPN also relies on dozens of fauxperts and homegrown research to promote and support endless amounts of false claims. One of the most effective methods for designing and circulating disinformation is adopting the conventions for professional and academic genres and finding fauxperts to generate and support misleading statements that condition audiences to trust the SPN. Disinformation networks also acquire significant power from layering disinformation tactics together and linking them across platforms. Each layer of disinformation is one step further away from transparency. The labor and time required to pull apart and analyze numerous layers of disinformation is overwhelming and disorienting. Furthermore, I contend that networked platforms that design disinformation are disinplatforms. Learning how to identify a disinformation network and how this network designs and circulates disinformation across multiple platforms is an important digital literacy needed to promote and, perhaps, save democracy in the age of disinformation.
